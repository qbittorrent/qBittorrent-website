The qBittorrent project aims to provide an open-source software alternative to µTorrent.

Additionally, qBittorrent runs and provides the same features on all major platforms (FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, OS/2, Windows).

qBittorrent is based on the <a href="https://www.qt.io/" target="_blank">Qt</a> toolkit and <a href="https://www.libtorrent.org/" target="_blank">libtorrent-rasterbar</a> library.

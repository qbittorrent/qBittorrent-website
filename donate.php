<p><b>BountySource DISCLAIMER:</b> A feature implementation or a bug fix might not get accepted and instead be rejected.
Some of the reasons might be code quality that isn't up to par with the rest of the project, poor code architecture/engineering, implementing a feature that doesn't actually fit with qBittorrent or we don't want to have it.
Generally objective reasons. The only subjective reason is rejecting a feature simply because we don't want it in qBittorrent (however we take the community's desires into consideration too).
We won't reject a feature/bugfix simply to deny a person a bounty or to claim the bounty for ourselves or another affiliated person.
Lastly, due to workload and our limited time `Pull Requests` may not be reviewed/merged in a timely manner.

[![GitHub Actions CI Status](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent-website/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent-website/actions)

This repository contains the official qBittorrent website: https://www.qbittorrent.org

Anyone is welcome to submit PRs that fix problems and improve things.

You can also submit redesigns but first open a bug report informing us and maybe show some mockups. Otherwise, you run the risk of wasting your time in case we won't agree with the redesign.

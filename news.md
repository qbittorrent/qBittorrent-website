### Monday November 16th 2020 - Donation info updates

The donation info has been updated to better reflect the expectations of donating to the project. Donations are made as a "Thank You" and with no expectation of any kind of obligation by us, eg having to implement feature X or Y.<br>
The development of qbittorrent is done by volunteers and we don't employ programmers or other people to work on the project. There are a few lead programmers that coordinate most things on github and also contribute code.<br>
Donations are appreciated as a "Thank You". You can choose to help with the server costs (website, forum, domain) and/or donate to lead programmers.

Because the development is volunteer driven, we can't set very specific goals. At the end of the day a volunteer will fix/implement whatever pleases him/her. We can't dictate to volunteers to work on specific things if they don't want to. The same applies to lead programmers. We are volunteers too.<br>
However, if you want specific features implemented or issues solved you may look at our [Bountysource page](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/qbittorrent/issues). There you can post a monetary bounty for an issue/feature and **maybe** someone is incentivized enough to fix/implement it.

For details, see [donation page](/donate).

PS: The old cryptocoin addresses have been retired. Please don't continue sending funds there. Accumulated funds will be used as reserves mostly for covering server costs in the future.

### Thursday October 22nd 2020 - qBittorrent v4.3.0.1 release

qBittorrent v4.3.0.1 was released.<br>
This is a minor release to address crashes on Windows related to torrents with URL seeds (`HTTP Sources` in the qbittorrent window). These crashes were exposed due to boost 1.74. Boost 1.73 doesn't have this problem. However, libtorrent also fixed the issue on their end so the Windows installers use the newer libtorrent code.<br>
The rest of the release is almost the same as v4.3.0 (see changelog). Since other platforms weren't affected only Windows builds will be made available for this version.<br>

v4.3.0.1 changelog:
- WINDOWS: NSIS: Update Italian translation (bovirus)

### Sunday October 18th 2020 - qBittorrent v4.3.0 release

qBittorrent v4.3.0 was released.<br>
This is a major version release due to the high number of accumulated changes and due to the long time since the last release.<br>
Some notes:
* Theming support has been enhanced but previous theme bundles will not work properly with this release. Please contact the theme provider for a fix. The new format is described [here](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/How-to-use-custom-UI-themes).
* If you want faster tracker announce rate or are having a slower client exit(compared to 4.2.x) then you may try increasing the `Max concurrent HTTP announce` limit from advanced settings.
* The latest version of libtorrent used contains many important fixes compared to the last one, including memory leaks and speed issues due to wrong caching logic on Windows.
* Qt 5.15.1 is used which offers far better HiDPI support. However, the torrent context menu will close after each tag selection.
* Brave users can download experimental builds from "Actions CI" on github.

### Thursday September 7th 2017 - qBittorrent v3.3.16 and 3.4.0beta2_20170709_cbfbae14090 release

Since it was a month since the last stable and v3.4.0 seems to be delayed just a bit, it was a good time to backport critical fixes and do another v3.3.x release.<br>

### Thursday August 3rd 2017 - qBittorrent v3.3.15 release

qBittorrent v3.3.15 was released. Very minor release to fix a possibly annoying problem.
3.4.0beta is being prepped and will be released this weekend. Stay tuned.
- BUGFIX: Temporary subfolder wasn't being deleted. (glassez)

### Thursday July 20th 2017 - qBittorrent v3.3.14 release

qBittorrent v3.3.14 was released.
1. This release is made mainly to fix the previous problematic fix for Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks via the webui.
2. It also contains another Webui fix for a DNS rebinding attack. For all WebUI users, if your qBittorrent server is assigned with a domain name, it is recommended to enter the domain name in `GUI: Options -> WebUI tab -> Server domains textbox` or in `config: Preferences section -> WebUI/ServerDomains` in order to defend against DNS rebinding attacks.
3. For macOS users: This is my first attempt to have a shortcut to `Applications` folder in the dmg. I hope that I didn't screw up the presentation.
4. Google has decided that qBittorrent is a persona non-grata. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/6obxsa/google_bans_bittorrent/) reddit post for more info.
5. Either this weekend or the next one you will get a beta for v3.4.0. It has A LOT of new features so help in finding grave bugs. Keep checking back to see if it is posted.

### Tuesday March 7th 2017 - NOTICE to tracker operators: User agent change

Starting from the next version (v3.3.12) qBittorrent will use the following user-agent format:
```
qBittorrent/A.B.C.DE
```
`A`, `B`, `C` and `D` are numbers indicating `VERSION_MAJOR`, `VERSION_MINOR`, `VERSION_BUGFIX` and `VERSION_BUILD` respectively.<br/>
If `D` is zero it will be omitted. The 3rd dot(`.`) will be omitted in this case.<br/>
`A`, `B` and `C` will always be present.<br/>
`E` is a string and possible values of it are `alpha`, `beta` and `rc`. They might not appear in all lowercase. Also they might appear numbered eg `alpha2`.<br/>
If `E` is empty it will be omitted. This indicates a stable release.<br/>
There is no connection between `D` and `E`. One might be present even if the other isn't.
To sum up and give an example, the user agent that v3.3.12 will use is `qBittorrent/3.3.12`.

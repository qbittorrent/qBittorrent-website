  <h3>Saturday February 13th 2016 - The forum is restored</h3>
</a>
<p>As mentioned
  <a href="#forum_compromise">earlier</a>, there were reports that the forums from a bunch of bittorrent related sites were hacked. As a result we switched off our forum to investigate. To the best of our knowledge we weren't hacked. We didn't discover any evidence of unauthorized entry. We highly suspect that the self-proclaimed "hacker" was a fraud instead. Just so you know the passwords are saved hashed and salted in the database. It is very difficult to reverse this and obtain the real password. In any case, we reset all the passwords and switched on the forum. You already should have received an email about your new password.</p>

<h3>Saturday October 10th 2015 - qBittorrent v3.2.4 release</h3>
<p>qBittorrent v3.2.4 was released. This release finally fixes an obscure "hit-and-run" bug with trackers.
  It is actually a libtorrent bug which is fixed in their source. But for fixing builds that will use older versions of
                libtorrent (eg on Linux) I made a change in the v3.2.4 code that will circumvent the bug anyway.
                This version should be the last in the v3.2.x series. The upcoming v3.3.x is pretty stable and we'll focus to streamline it for release.<br>
  PS: Ubuntu and OS X builds will be available in a few hours.</p>

<h3>Sunday February 22nd 2015 - qBittorrent v3.1.12 release</h3>
<p>This is merely an excuse for a new and correct build for OSX users. The previous versions didn't work on older hardware. In the meantime I backported some important fixes for Windows which resulted in crashes too.</p>
<ul>
  <li>OSX: Fix build to work with older machines. (sledgehammer999, Noctem)</li>
  <li>WINDOWS: Fix automatic Python download. (sledgehammer999)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Wednesday December 17th 2014 - qBittorrent v3.1.11.1 release</h3>
<p>This is a Mac OS X release. This is the same source as v3.1.11. The difference is in the way it is compiled. Now it doesn't crash during launch due to incorrect dynamic library linking. Provided by user
  <b>DomT4</b>
  (github)</p>

<h3>Thursday November 27th 2014 - Ubuntu PPAs</h3>
<p>As you may have noticed already our Ubuntu PPAs were broken for quite some time now. Chris Dumez, who maintained them, was unable to fix them. Today I managed to create new and working PPAs. Head over to the
  <a href="download">download page</a>
  and find the new PPAs. You should remove the old ones to avoid conflicts.</p>

<h3>Wednesday October 22nd 2014 - qBittorrent v3.1.11 release</h3>
<p>qBittorrent v3.1.11 was released. I know I said that v3.1.10 would be the last of the v3.1.x series. However there were 2-3 regressions that warranted a new release. In the meantime, more bugfixes and features were committed by others. So v3.1.11
  <b>should be</b>
  the last unless we find some serious issues with it.</p>
<p>Also some Windows 7 users experienced freezing of the GUI. We tracked it down to a specific commit in boost 1.56. So until boost fixes it, I am going to use boost 1.55 for Windows releases.</p>

<h3>December 10th 2009 - qBittorrent v2.0.0 final release</h3>
<p>As planned, qBittorrent v2.0.0 final was released today after a rather long period of test, which was necessary due to the large number of features/changes introduced. We really received a lot of feedback regarding v2.0.0 betas and release candidates and we would like to thank the brave people who tested it.</p>
<p>qBittorrent v2.0.0 changelog is available
  <a href="http://qbittorrent.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/qbittorrent/trunk/Changelog?revision=3083&amp;view=markup">here</a>.</p>

<h3>December 2nd 2009 - qBittorrent v2.0.0rc4 and competition finalist</h3>
<p>Just a short article to announce that qBittorrent v2.0.0rc4 was released. It is stable and the UI will not change. I am now simply waiting for late translation updates so that I can make a final release (probably on December 10th)</p>
<p>Another good news is that qBittorrent project is now a finalist in "desktop applications" category in
  <a href="http://etoiles-du-libre.org">"Les Etoiles Du Libre"</a>
  Free Software competition. The winning projects will be selected on December 12th so let's keep our fingers crossed!</p>

<h3>November 28th 2009 - qBittorrent v2.0.0rc2 and more search engine plugins</h3>
<p>We have released today a second release candidate for qBittorrent v2.0.0. A lot of users decided to give v2.0.0 a try as soon as they saw the screenshots and we thank them for their useful feedback. Thanks to their effort, qBittorrent v2.0.0 final will be released sooner than expected.</p>
<p>We also recently moved our wiki to Sourceforge and we wrote a
  <a href="https://doc.qbittorrent.org">new documentation</a>
  for qBittorrent v2.0. The documentation is complete already.</p>
<p>Another recent news was that
  <a href="http://www.mininova.org">Mininova</a>
  engine disabled access to over a million torrent files when it partly shut down its website due to legal issues. After this news, TorrentFreak published a list of
  <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/10-alternatives-to-mininova-091126/">10 alternatives to Mininova</a>. We decided it would be useful to support these 10 search engines in qBittorrent. As a result, we are currently publishing new plugins on
  <a href="https://plugins.qbittorrent.org">Plugins.qbittorrent.org</a>. 4 new plugins are available at the time I'm writing this news while qBittorrent already supported 3 engines listed in the Top 10. This means that only 3 more plugins are missing to support the whole Top 10.</p>

<h3>November 17th 2009 - qBittorrent v1.5.6 release and qBittorrent v2.0.0 news</h3>
<p>Here is another bugfix release for qBittorrent v1.5.x while waiting for the next major release: qBittorrent v2.0.0. Development on v2.0.0 is going really well and we are hoping it will be ready in a month or so. qBittorrent v2.0 brings a lot of new features and UI changes. The list of changes is available
  <a href="http://qbittorrent.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/qbittorrent/trunk/Changelog?view=markup">here</a>
  but to summarize it should be a very close equivalent to the official Bittorrent client: µTorrent, in all levels: features, UI, lightness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>BUGFIX: RSS feed articles can now be displayed using keyboard arrows</li>
